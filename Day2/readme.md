# Sorting Algorithms
## we always sort (n-1) elements in any sorting algo.
### Bubble Sorting (max element at its correct place).
### Selection Sorting (min element at its correct place).
### Insertion Sorting
- In Insertion Sort, elements are picked one by one from the unsorted portion and inserted into their correct position in the sorted portion.
- It starts by assuming the first element is sorted and then repeatedly inserts each subsequent element into its correct position.
- It works similarly to how people sort playing cards in their hands.
